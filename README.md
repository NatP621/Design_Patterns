# OOP-2
â€¨As part of a major project in object-oriented programming, my goal is to implement the essential features of a social network platform. This project emphasizes the design and integration of fundamental methods while using design patterns to ensure a robust and maintainable software architecture. I apply OOP principles to structure user interactions, manage posts, and handle notifications, all while adhering to best practices in software design.
